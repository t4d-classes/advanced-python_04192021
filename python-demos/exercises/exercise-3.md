# Exercise 3

1. Using the various mechanisms previously employed, run an additional thread to output each rate dictionary to a CSV file as the rate dictionary objects are created.

Hint: rate dictionary is the dictionary added to the processed responses list.

2. Run the code with a time diff code, and record the execution time.

3. Make a copy of the file of the threaded version of the program. Rename the copied file to something with the word "thread" in it. Modify the code in the `__main__.py` file to remove the threading, and run each step in order on a single thread. Run the program and record the execution time. Compare the times between the two programs. Which one took longer?
